# SIF-basis
SIF is a framework developed by Sweco for [iMOD](https://oss.deltares.nl/web/imod)-modelling. SIF-basis is the part of it that is publicly available.

The SIF-framework is used for some of the regional groundwatermodels in the Netherlands, e.g. AZURE+UGM, IBRAHYM, MIPWA and also for the Dutch Hydrological Instrument ([NHI](https://nhi.nu/)).

Currently just the SIF-batchfiles are shared here. These batchfiles should be used together with the corresponding [SIF-tools](https://github.com/SIF-framework/SIF-tools).
The rest of the framework can be requisted via the regional consortia or via Sweco.

See the [Sweco presentation for the 'iMOD Gebruikersdag 2019'](https://www.slideshare.net/deltaressoftwaredagen/dsdnl-2019-ontwikkelingen-swecoinstrumentarium-voor-imod-van-der-hauw), for an idea of the main features of SIF-basis.
