# SIF-basis
SIF is a framework by Sweco for iMOD-modelling. SIF-basis is the part of it that is publicly available.

Note: currently only some of the batch files are present in GitHub. The complete SIF-basis version can be requested via koen.vanderhauw[@]sweco.nl. See the [Sweco presentation for the 'iMOD Gebruikersdag 2019'](https://www.slideshare.net/deltaressoftwaredagen/dsdnl-2019-ontwikkelingen-swecoinstrumentarium-voor-imod-van-der-hauw), for an idea of the main features of SIF-basis.
