Workflow FlowPaths - Basis
--------------------------

Purpose
-------
Create zone using flowpath calculations, with specified traveltime around source as defined in an IPF-file 

Description
-----------
1) Perform backward flowpath-run starting around source and with specified traveltime, to retrieve general area of zone
2) Peform forward flowpath-run starting from a buffer around backwards zone
3) Select flowlines and points that end in or pass the specified source
4) Create IDF-file from all starting points that end in or pass the specified source and a traveltime less than or equal to the specified traveltime
5) Create a boundary hull for the zone in the IDF-file. The resulting IDF-file will have a cellsize as specified by variabele FPFW_ISDP_N1
Optionally, the results can be converted to ASC-grids and shapefiles and metadata is added automatically based on specified settings.

Remarks
-------
Optionally use SIF FlowPath-legends as present in iMOD LEGEND-folder.
In case of unexpected results, check FlowPath-settings ISNK, FRACTION, traveltimes and volumes for selection. Check iMOD-version and check intermediate results in iMOD.
